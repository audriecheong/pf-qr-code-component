## Overview

This is the very first challenge I've finished on Frontend Mentor. Through this challenge, I learnt how to make a QR component by using a card. I use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 4 in order to achieve the most accurate visual.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Bootstrap 4
